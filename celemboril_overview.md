#### **History**
Founded nearly 200 years ago on ruins of an older city by six elven artisans. This history is kept up with their current politics where guilds work together. The city's ruled by the High Council of Celemboril which consists of members of influential Merchant Guilds. They meet at the Hall of Silverlight to decide edicts. Membership in a guild ensures protection and support, while outsiders often find life much harder. Originally known for their weaponsmiths, then lots of silver deposits was found on island and they got rich.

#### **Law & Order**
Celemboril maintains a Civic Guard under the command of Blackthorne Company of Arms. They are tasked with enforcing the council’s laws. They will protect you if you got coin or if you are important. Shroudwarden Justicars will help poor people get justice, if you follow their beliefs. They have to tread carefully and not step on guild toes too hard. For the disenfranchised, there are the gangs who keep their own honor code.

#### **Politics**

Most influential guilds, [[Silmarien Mining Consortium]] lead by [[House Silmarien]] and [[Artisans Guild]]  lead by [[House Daerhallow]]
- Fierce rivals. Silmarien is more influential thanks to the shrewd matriach who has been leading the house for over 50 years

##### High Council
- Seats on the Council are allocated primarily to the two biggest guilds — [[Silmarien Mining Consortium]] and [[Artisans Guild]] with each holding two permanent seats due to their economic influence and historical status
- Rotating Seats are available to other guilds, such as [[Mercantile Guild]], [[Blackthorne Company of Arms]], and other minor guilds. Every few years, minor houses can vie for these rotating seats.
- The council is capped at six seats (4 for major houses, 2 rotating seats) to prevent stagnation and allow new, rising houses to have a voice.
- The council elects a [[Grand Exarch]] from among its members, who acts as the chief executive and symbolic head of the city. The Grand Exarch’s responsibilities include presiding over council sessions, representing Celemboril in diplomatic affairs, and making tie-breaking votes.
- The position of Grand Exarch is elected every five years, and no house can hold the position for more than two consecutive terms to ensure that power remains balanced. The role typically alternates between the three major houses, although minor houses occasionally secure the title in times of crisis or economic shift.
